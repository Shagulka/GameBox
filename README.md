# The Game Box allows users to choose and play a game from a set of 14 options. The games are:
1) Rock, paper, scissors. Your program must be biased to picking “rock” a bit more than the other
options.
2) Guess a number using a binary search strategy (example below). The program asks someone
to pick a whole number between 1 and 100. Then, the program tries to guess that number.
3) You are NOT allowed to use Arrays!!! Write a program that verifies if a given number n is a
Palindromic number. Palindromic numbers are “a number (such as 16461) that remains the
same when its digits are reversed” – Wikipedia.
4) Write a program that verifies if a given number n is a Palindromic number. This time, using
arrays.
5) Given a number n, your program must print the sum of the first n positive numbers. In addition,
your program must print the first “n” positive and even numbers. (Example: if n=3, the program
will print: “The sum of the 3 first positive numbers is 6”; and then: “The first 3 positive and even
numbers are 2, 4, 6”).
6) Given a number n, your program must calculate and print n! (What kinds of numbers are valid
for this problem?)
7) Your program will calculate and print the first n Fibonacci numbers.
8) You will build a program that asks for a temperature in Fahrenheit, converts it to Celsius, and
prints it.
9) You will build a program that asks a user to provide a distance in kilometers and the total elapsed
time in hours. Your program will print the average speed in kilometers per hour.
10) NOTE: You are NOT allowed to use % (modulo operator) to get the remainder. Your program
will get a 3-digit number from user input. Then, it will calculate the number’s remainder from a
division by 10. Your program will print: the remainder and the other two digits from the input
number. Example: if a user types 193, your program will print: “the remainder is 3, and the
other two units in 193 are 19”.
11) Given n and two positive integers i and j, your program will print, in ascending order, the n first
positive numbers that are multiples of i, or j, or both. (You are not allowed to use the modulo
operator %). Example: for n= 6, i = 2, and j = 3, your program should print: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.
12) Your program will ask a number from the user and then verify if the number is perfect. Example:
6 is a perfect number since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Run your program to find out: Is 496 a perfect
number? (You are not allowed to use the modulo operator %)
13) Two integers a and b, are congruent modulo n if they have the same remainder when divided
by n. Given the positive integers a, b, and n, your program will print if a and b are congruent
modulo n. Hint: you can use a = 35; b = 39; n =4. (You are not allowed to use the modulo
operator %).
14) Your program will ask the user to provide an integer n. Given n, your program will check if it is
the result of three consecutive integers multiplied. Example: 504 should print “yes, the provided
number is the result of three consecutive integers multiplied, since 7 * 8 * 9 = 504”.
